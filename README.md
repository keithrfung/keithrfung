# Hi, I'm Keith! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35px" />

Just a software engineer coding up a storm among the [octocats](https://octodex.github.com/). Here's a little about me:

- 🔭 Adore collaborating on open source projects and for good causes.
- 👏🏼 Love to lead and mentor. Always ready to help.
- 🗳 Worked on Microsoft's [ElectionGuard](electionguard.vote)
- 💻 No language preference. Give me a language. I'll code it.
- 🧗 Bouldering and rock climbing is one of [my passions](https://www.instagram.com/p/CU6Gl1bFm2v/)!
